# Classification Home Credit Indonesia using PyCaret

# Objective


The objective of this notebook will be to tackle the same classification problem from the Kickstarter notebook using the power of PyCaret. We will be exploring more advanced features and capabilities of PyCaret along the way:


-  __Getting Data:__ Learn how to import default datasets from PyCaret repository

-  __Custom Environment Setup:__ Learn how to setup a custom experiment in PyCaret with advanced data transformations!

-  __Compare Models:__ Learn how to compare multiple machine learning models for the given classification task based on model evaluation metrics

-  __Create Model:__ Learn how to create specific classifical models, perform stratified cross validation and evaluate classification metrics

-  __Ensemble Model:__ Learn how to automatically ensemble classification models in different ways

-  __Plot Model:__ Learn how to analyze model performance using various diagnostic plots

-  __Finalize Model:__ Learn how to finalize the best model at the end of the experiment

-  __Predict Model:__ Learn how to make predictions on application test
